       "AIMessage(content=\"Playing basketball can be a fun and rewarding experience, whether you're a beginner or a seasoned player. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to play basketball:\\n\\n**Objective:**\\nThe objective of basketball is to score more points than the opposing team by shooting a ball through a hoop (called a basket) using various techniques such as dribbling, passing, and shooting.\\n\\n**Basic Rules:**\\n\\n1. **The Game**: A standard basketball game is played between two teams, each consisting of five players. The game is divided into four quarters, each lasting 12 minutes in professional play and 8 minutes in college and high school play.\\n2. **The Court**: The game takes place on a rectangular court with a hoop (called a basket) at each end. The court is divided into two halves, with a mid-court line in the center.\\n3. **The Ball**: The ball must be bounced or dribbled to move it around the court. Players can use one hand to dribble, but not two hands at the same time.\\n4. **Scoring**: Points can be scored in several ways:\\n\\t* **Field Goal**: When a player shoots the ball into the opponent's basket (2 points).\\n\\t* **Three-Pointer**: When a player shoots the ball from behind the three-point line (3 points).\\n\\t* **Free Throw**: When a player is awarded a shot from the free throw line after being fouled (1 point).\\n\\n**Basic Skills:**\\n\\n1. **Dribbling**: Bouncing the ball on the floor to move it around the court.\\n2. **Passing**: Throwing the ball to a teammate.\\n3. **Shooting**: Throwing the ball into the opponent's basket.\\n4. **Rebounding**: Grabbing the ball after a shot is missed.\\n\\n**How to Play:**\\n\\n1. **Start of the Game**: The game begins with a jump ball, where two players from each team jump up and try to tap the ball to a teammate.\\n2. **Ball Movement**: Players can move the ball by dribbling or passing to teammates.\\n3. **Scoring Opportunities**: Players can create scoring opportunities by:\\n\\t* **Driving to the Basket**: Dribbling the ball towards the basket and attempting to score.\\n\\t* **Shooting from the Perimeter**: Shooting the ball from outside the three-point line.\\n4. **Defending**: Players can defend by:\\n\\t* **Guarding the Ball**: Staying in front of the opponent and trying to steal the ball.\\n\\t* **Blocking Shots**: Jumping up to block an opponent's shot.\\n5. **Rebounding**: Players can grab the ball after a shot is missed and create a new scoring opportunity.\\n6. **End of the Game**: The team with the most points at the end of four quarters wins the game.\\n\\n**Tips for Beginners:**\\n\\n1. **Practice Dribbling**: Start by practicing dribbling with one hand, then switch to the other hand.\\n2. **Work on Your Shot**: Practice shooting from different spots on the court, such as the free throw line, the three-point line, and the post.\\n3. **Play with Others**: Join a local basketball league or play with friends to improve your skills and learn from others.\\n4. **Focus on Fundamentals**: Master the basic skills of dribbling, passing, and shooting before moving on to more advanced techniques.\\n\\n**Advanced Techniques:**\\n\\n1. **Crossover Dribble**: A move where the player switches the ball from one hand to the other while dribbling.\\n2. **Behind-the-Back Dribble**: A move where the player dribbles the ball behind their back to avoid a defender.\\n3. **Alley-Oop**: A play where a player throws the ball to a teammate who is near the basket, and the teammate dunks the ball.\\n4. **Pick and Roll**: A play where a player sets a screen for a teammate, and the teammate uses the screen to drive to the basket or shoot.\\n\\nRemember, the key to improving your basketball skills is to practice regularly and have fun playing the game!\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 840, 'prompt_tokens': 39, 'total_tokens': 879, 'completion_time': 1.70275138, 'prompt_time': 0.002507879, 'queue_time': 0.101287541, 'total_time': 1.705259259}, 'model_name': 'llama-3.3-70b-versatile', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_155ab82e98', 'service_tier': 'on_demand', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run--548cf895-ec80-4be2-8c43-0ab2c200f9c2-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 39, 'output_tokens': 840, 'total_tokens': 879})"

    "prompt_template = \"US President Donald Trump says India has offered to cut its tariffs to nothing even as he called the current trade stalemate with the country a totally one sided disaster.US tariffs of 50% on goods from India - which includes 25% penalty for Delhi's refusal to stop buying oil from Russia - took effect last week.India has not responded to Trump's latest comment but such war of words over Russian oil has caused Delhi-Washington ties to hit an all-time low.Trump's comment coincides with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi attending the Shanghai Co-operation Organisation (SCO) summit in Tianjin where he met Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin.Washington says Delhi has been indirectly funding Russia's war in Ukraine.India buys most of its oil and military products from Russia, very little from the US, Trump wrote, adding Delhi should have cut tariffs years ago.Delhi has previously said that oil supply from Russia was vital to meet the energy needs of its vast populationIt has also called the tariffs unfair, unjustified and unreasonable.Last week, the country's commerce minister, Piyush Goyal, said India will neither bow down nor ever appear weak in its economic relationships with other countries.He also said the country was ready to a have a free-trade agreement with anyone who wanted it.On Monday, Trump wrote: What few people understand is that we do very little business with India, but they do a tremendous amount of business with us. In other words, they sell us massive amounts of goods, their biggest client, but we sell them very little - Until now a totally one sided relationship, and it has been for many decades.The Indian PM said he had an insightful exchange with Putin.\"\n",
